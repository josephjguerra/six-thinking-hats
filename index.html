  <h1>What is Six Thinking Hats?</h1>
  <p>Six Thinking Hats is a form of parallel thinking, where you focus on a single direction of thinking to solve a problem or brainstorm an idea. You separate emotion from logic, creativity from information, and positivity from caution.</p>
  <p>A group using Six Thinking Hats fully utilizes everyone's knowledge, intelligence, and experiences. You avoid confusion and time-consuming arguments.</p>
  <p>The hats are a metaphor that represent each type of thinking. Hats are easy to put on and take off. They are clearly visible. They indicate a type of thinking. Refer to hats by their color, not their function.</p>

  <h1>Who made Six Thinking Hats?</h1>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono">Dr. Edward de Bono</a>, a Maltese physician, psychologist, author, inventor, and consultant, wrote the Six Thinking Hats book in 1985. He has authored over 50 other books on thought.</p>
  <p>He is a proponent of teaching thinking as a subject in schools. He also teaches thinking methods to government agencies, corporate clients, organizations and individuals, in private and publicly group sessions.</p>

  <h1>What are the benefits?</h1>
  <div class="benefits">
    <h2>Power</h2>
    <p>Everyone is thinking, working, and looking in the same direction, like rowers in a boat or focused sun rays.</p>
    <h2>Time saving</h2>
    <p>Take less time since there is no need to respond or argue while everyone explores ideas in the same direction.</p>
    <h2>Remove ego</h2>
    <p>Ego undermines effective thinking. Exert your effort into performing well as a thinker under each hat, instead of disproving or arguing.</p>
    <h2>One thing at a time</h2>
    <p>Dedicate attention to a single task. Doing too many things at once causes confusion and inefficiency. Juggling one ball is easier than many.</p>
